<h2><span id="logo">&#x2600;</span>WasmSpider 0.0.1 WebAssembly Benchmark</h2>

<p>This is WasmSpider, a WebAssembly benchmark. This benchmark tests the
core WebAssembly language only, not the DOM or other browser APIs. It
is designed to compare different versions of the same browser, and
different browsers to each other. Unlike many widely available
WebAssembly benchmarks, this test is:</p>

<dl>

<dt>An Attempt at Humor</dt>
<dd>This test is specifically intended to initially cause a slightly more
forceful nasal exhalation. Once you realize that the test is actually
functional, that should be followed by a sense of disbelief that someone
seriously spent their time writing this just to make a joke.</dd>

<dt>Real World</dt>
<dd>This test mostly avoids microbenchmarks, and tries to focus on
the kinds of actual problems developers solve with WebAssembly today,
and the problems they may want to tackle in the future as the language
gets faster. This includes tests to generate a tagcloud from JSON
input, a 3D raytracer, cryptography tests, code decompression, and
many more examples. There are a few microbenchmarkish things, but they
mostly represent real performance problems that developers have
encountered.</dd>

<dt>Statistically Sound</dt>
<dd>One of the challenges of benchmarking is knowing how much noise
you have in your measurements. This benchmark runs each test multiple
times and determines an error range (technically, a 95% confidence
interval). In addition, in comparison mode it tells you if you have
enough data to determine if the difference is statistically
significant.</dd>

</dl>

<p><b>Current version - wasmspider-0.0.1:</b> <a href="driver.html">Start Now!</a><br>
<small>(When you run the benchmark, be patient - it loops through all of the
test cases five times and can take a minute or longer to complete.)</small></p>
